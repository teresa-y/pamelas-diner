			<h3>About</h3>
			Pamela's Diner is a prominent chain of diners in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 
			USA. Its specialties are crepe-style pancakes, omelets and Lyonnaise potatoes. 
			It is "treasured" and is considered to be in the "pantheon of pancake purveyors". 
			In 2013, Pamela's Diner was featured by the Wall Street Journal in a 
			"What to Do in Pittsburgh" feature story. Pamela's Diner is owned by 
			Gail Klingensmith and Pam Cohen.[1] Both educated as teachers, the 
			business partners handle different tasks, Klingensmith with the more 
			business end and Cohen as "the culinary artist". The first Pamela's 
			Diner location, in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood, opened in 1979. 
			Subsequent locations have opened in Shadyside, the Strip District, 
			Millvale, Oakland and Mt. Lebanon.

			<h3>Recent Updates</h3>
			During the 2008 United States presidential election, Barack Obama 
			visited Pamela's Diner for a campaign visit. Once elected, President
			Obama invited Klingensmith and Cohen to the White House for a Memorial 
			Day breakfast with the Obama family and 80 veterans. Later that year, 
			during the 2009 G-20 Pittsburgh summit, President Obama expressed dismay 
			that he was unable to return to Pamela's Diner during that trip, but 
			First Lady Michelle Obama did visit. Incidentally, the Oakland storefront 
			received damage during the protests that accompanied the G-20 summit.<br/><br/>
			Pamela's Diner announced in December 2021 that their original Squirrel 
			Hill location will be closing largely due to COVID-19. With the loss 
			of several long-time employees, the location decided to shut its doors. 
			As the first Pamela's Diner location, it has been around 42 years. 
			The other diner locations will stay open, however. The owners hinted 
			that they are open to another, smaller Squirrel Hill location in the 
			future.
