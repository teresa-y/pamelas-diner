        <h3>What's Everyone Saying?</h3> <!--reviews, taken from yelp page-->
        <h4>Five stars all around! Reviews from TripAdvisor, Google, and Yelp</h4>
        <p> "Pamela's Diner has been a staple of the Strip District and other
            neighborhoods throughout the city. They have the most incredible 
            lyonnaise potatoes, hot cakes, breakfast varieties for all. I highly
            recommend this Strip District location just for the historical 
            photographs and ambience of the 50's style diner." - Racheallee L.</p>
        <p> "We came here on recommendation and we were not let down. I got the 
            Pittsburgh hash - which was kielbasa, sauerkraut, and potatoes with 
            choice of egg and toast. This hash was different and full of flavor. 
            We also got an order of chocolate chip banana hot cakes. The hot cakes 
            were like fried crepes - super thin and buttery and a little crunchy in 
            parts. Filled with banana and chocolate chips... I could eat these all 
            day for the rest of my life. So good. SO GOOD." - Erin H.</p>
        <p> "I got the meat & eggs. Got bacon, wheat toast, eggs and their delicious 
            potatoes! They had an amazing flavor! I usually dislike onions but 
            they made it in a way where it was delicious. They give you a wonderful 
            portion and it came out fast! Loved the butter on the toast, they put 
            just the right amount. The bf got the tex mex omelet and loved it. 
            The unsweetened tea was great too. It's definitely a local favorite 
            and it was busy! Our waitress was amazing and made our day. 
            We will definitely return!" - Valerie M.</p>
